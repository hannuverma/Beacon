## Features

1. Event Updates will be shared on our community forum where user can know about various communities based on their location and interests.
2. User starts a trip after setting target destination, and can share their live location, which will allow us to ensure their safety.
3. SOS button is provided to send any alert signals in case of emergency during the trip.
4. We can use this data to measure crowd density in a area and detect busy zones.
5. Community Reports about the local region helps us guide user better
6. Dead or unsafe region can be removed from the map
